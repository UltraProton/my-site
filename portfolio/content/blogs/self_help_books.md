## 1. A mind for numbers by Barbara Oakley
This book by [Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/) will unarguably the best book I have read till date which has really helped me in improving my techniques of learning. You will be amazed to see that we
were studying the wrong way all these years.

## 2. The power of Habit by Charles Duhigg
Another gem of a book to understand why we do what we do. It helps to understand the nature of our habits and how can we change them to adapt the good habits and grow well in life.

## 3. Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiosaki
This is a book to get yourself acuainted with the financial knowledge which many indians lack.

## 4. Talking to strangers by Malcolm Gladwell
I have started reading this book and will talk about it as I keep reading. This book was gifted to me by my M.Tech professor at IIT Hyderbad [Dr. Saurabh Joshi](https://sbjoshi.github.io/). This book talks about how talking and listening skills are crucial for the modern world.
